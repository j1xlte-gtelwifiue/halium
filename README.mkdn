Halium
===========

This manifest is based off of [wecouldcalliteven/android](https://github.com/wecouldcalliteven/android) as [they](https://github.com/Exynos3475/android_device_samsung_j1xlte/tree/lineage-17.1) were having trouble with the latest one. See their repository for more details.

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Halium, you'll need to get
familiar with [Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) and [Version Control with Git](https://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Halium trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/j1xlte-gtelwifiue/halium.git -b halium-10.0 --depth=1
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
Please see the [Halium Documentation](http://docs.halium.org/) for building instructions, by device.
